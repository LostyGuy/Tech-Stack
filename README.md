# 🛠 Tech-Stack

  This repo is an overview of the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools I've worked with.  
  For each entry, I include:
  - **Usage** → How I've applied it
  - **Projects** → Links to repos
  - **Confidence** → My self-assessment (Learning | Beginner | Intermediate | Confident)
